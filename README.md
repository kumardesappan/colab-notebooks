# Google Colab Notebooks
  This repository contains Google Colab Notebooks for simple ML/DL Models experiments. The primary target is Model Inference.

## Create Models
- These script can be used as reference for creating Operator/Layer level models for unit level testing of Inference Software
	- create_onnx_model.ipynb
  - create_tflite_model.ipynb

## Run Inference on Pre-trained Models
- These scripts can be used as reference for developing inference software for Pretrained DL models. 
  -  infer_caffe.ipynb
  -  infer_ort.ipynb
  -  infer_tflite.ipynb

## Save Models Pre-Trained Weights
- These scripts can be used as reference for saving onnx/tflite models from public domain model hubs. 
  - save_keras_model.ipynb
  - save_timm_model.ipynb
  - save_torchvision_model.ipynb
